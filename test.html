  <h2 id="place" >A sense of place/non-place</h2>
    <p>A site-specific booklet and visual research of Lot 4/TP866378 (the corner of Little Lonsdale St. and Exhibition St.) and <a href="https://edisciplinas.usp.br/pluginfile.php/122106/mod_resource/content/1/Marc%20Aug%C3%A9%20Non-Places-%20An%20Introduction%20to%20Supermodernity%20%202009.pdf">Marc Augé's idea of the non-place</a>. Research which generated a considerable amount of content (more than I expected) through which my hypothesis of the lot as a non-place was proven incorrect. The lot turned out not only to be a place; but a place with a space.</p>

    <h2 id="ACMI"> <a href="https://www.acmi.net.au/">ACMI</a> data visualisation</h2>

    <p> Film is about people, lives and relations. And simply, this became my entry point into ACMI's dataset of 15 years of screened films. Manually filtering the datasets' movie titles, I collected all first-names of living persons, human characters, animals and animated characters.</p>
    <p> The names carry the narrative in a range of poster-titles, as a medium to reflect back on and showcase the dataset; the vast array of genres, themes, people and lives shown at ACMIs cinemas. The tone is straight and the colours are bright and vigorous, just like the dataset, and the dynamic spirit of ACMI.</p>

    <h2 id="batting" >Batting</h2>

    <p> Lars Batting is a man with an exceptional passion for the perfect bread. Our approach for Batting's bakery was to tell Lars Battings story with a poetic and abstract approach. This character of the brand was defined through linocuts based on shapes in Lars’ bread - in colors of the early morning sky ☾ when the bakers are at work. With this expressive, abstract visual universe, the logotype was set in a sharp and fixed typography. All to reflect the spirit of the bakery – which we hoped to pass on to customers of the bakery.</p>
